# Compiler-craze

- My attempt at making a compiler for C programming language. Other languages can wait.
- This is between me and the compiler. You can offer help, but I will walk on my own.

## Reasoning

- [James 2:26]: "For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without work is dead also." Within any modern OS, there are programs, born from humble ideas and materialized by compilers. There are many compilers, so I will start working on a default compiler for a powerful and trusted language: C (maybe C++ too).
- C is structure-oriented language, which for anyone but avid fans, requires more discipline from programmers at design and logical stage of developing source code.
- I miss Pascal, despite not being great at it. Looking at state of C, suffice to say that C is a staple language for any upcoming programmers.
